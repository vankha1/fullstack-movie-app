### What I've learnt

- Reviewing React Native fundamental
- Restful API using React Native, NestJS and GraphQL
- Using a state management library that simplifies managing remote and local data with GraphQL: Apollo Client (`https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/why-apollo/`)
- **Remind myself:** When fetching data, you must check error or loading conditions to avoid bullshit undefined behavior !!!

### What I should improve

- Try another complicated application
